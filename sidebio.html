  <p class="text">Manju Ashish Buddhaghosh (born on April 13, 1998) is an emerging Indian filmmaker, performer, writer, and director, making their directorial debut with the short film Purnviram. This engaging project is based on their satirical book of the same name, available on Amazon and Flipkart. Purnviram transforms sharp wit into a thrilling narrative, showcasing Buddhaghosh's unique storytelling style.</p>
  <p class="text">Her language contains elements from Aeolic vernacular and poetic tradition, with traces of epic vocabulary familiar to readers of Homer. She has the ability to judge critically her own ecstasies and grief, and her emotions lose nothing of their force by being recollected in tranquillity.</p>
